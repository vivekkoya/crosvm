// Closure pointers as *c_void
// -----------------
// This file interfaces with Slirp's callbacks extensively. As part of that, it passes Rust closures
// to callbacks as opaque data, and those closures are executed during a call into Slirp; in other
// words, the sequence of events looks like this:
//    1. Rust creates a closure C.
//    2. Rust calls Slirp and gives it callback CB (a Rust func.), and opaque data that contains C.
//    3. (0...n times) CB runs and unpacks C from the opaque data.
//          a. CB calls C.
//    4. The call from #2 completes.
// Closures are represented as trait objects, and trait object references are wide/fat pointers
// (2x machine pointer size) that contain pointers to the closure's struct & its vtable. Since wide
// pointers are obviously too large to fit into a *mut c_void (this is the opaque data), we cannot
// pass them directly. Luckily, wide pointers themselves are simple sized data structures, so we can
// pass a reference to the wide pointer as a *mut c_void; in other words, the way to pass a closure
// is to cast &mut &mut some_closure into a *mut c_void. We can then unpack this easily and call
// the closure.
//
// Why is CallbackHandler involved in the outbound (guest -> host) packet path?
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// In short, ownership. Since the CallbackHandler is responsible for writing to the guest, it must
// own the connection/stream that is attached to the guest. Because CallbackHandler owns the
// connection, it would be significantly complicated to have any other entity read from the
// connection.
//
// Safety assumptions
// ------------------
// Most statements explaining the safety of unsafe code depend on libslirp behaving in a safe
// & expected manner. Given that libslirp is has experienced CVEs related to safety problems,
// these statements should be taken with a grain of salt. Consumers of this library are STRONGLY
// RECOMMENDED to run this code in a separate process with strong sandboxing.

// Some bindings of the libslirp API are used, but we want to keep them for completeness

/// An instance of libslirp is represented by a Context, which provides methods that consumers use
/// to interact with Slirp. The Context is also where consumers register their CallbackHandler,
/// which provides required functions to libslirp, and allows libslirp to communicate back to the
/// consumer. The Context is intended to be used from an event loop which handles polling for IO
/// from the guest and host (see `Context.pollfds_fill`, `Context.pollfds_poll`, and
/// `Context.handle_guest_input`).
///
/// Example data flow for an outbound packet:
/// 1. Context `ctx` created with CallbackHandler `h`. An event loop (henceforth the slirp loop) is
///    started, which polls for packets from the guest, and from the outside world (sockets).
/// 2. Guest emits an ethernet frame. The consumer makes this frame available through their
///    implementation of `h.read_from_guest`.
/// 3. The slirp loop is notified there is a packet from the guest, and invokes
///    `ctx.handle_guest_input`. `ctx.handle_guest_input` reads all currently available packets
///    using `h.read_from_guest` & returns back to the slirp loop.
///
/// Example data flow for an inbound packet:
/// 1. Same as above.
/// 2. An ethernet frame arrives to the host, and gets demuxed by the host kernel into one of the
///    host sockets opened by libslirp.
/// 3. The slirp loop receives a notification that data has arrived on one of the libslirp sockets,
///    and invokes `ctx.pollfds_poll` to notify libslirp.
///    a. libslirp calls into `h.send_packet` to deliver the packet to the consumer.

/// To send NDP router advertisements on IPv6, libslirp uses a timer. If IPv6 support is not
/// needed, the timer callbacks can be left unimplemented.

/// Example data flow for timer creation/modification (`timer_new`/`timer_mod`/`timer_free`):
/// 1. libslirp calls into `timer_new` to request a new timer. `timer_new` creates some entity to
///    represent the timer and boxes it. A pointer to that boxed entity is returned to libslirp,
///    and is how libslirp will refer to the timer in the future.
/// 2. The timer's expire time can be changed when timer_mod is called by libslirp. A pointer to the
///    boxed timer is passed in by libslirp.
/// 3. The implementor of `CallbackHandler` is responsible for ensuring that the timer's callback as
///    provided in `timer_new` is invoked at/after the `expire_time`.
/// 4. libslirp will free timers using `timer_free` when `slirp_cleanup` runs.
///
/// libslirp never does anything with the timer pointer beyond passing it to/from the the functions
/// in `CallbackHandler`.
